This is a little bit about me. I've been involved in information technology since 1986 while I was serving in the US Army, I ran BBS systems in the 1990's, became a Data Specialist with AT&T in 1999 and then a Functional Analyst with Anteon Corporation in 2001.
I have since held desktop support, system administration, and Sharepoint administration duties for L-3, the US Army and the VA.
